# Sketch-of-Rage
This was the Unity Live Project I developed for the Tech Academy. It's a side-scrolling game inspired by Streets of Rage.

I created this solo project using C# and Unity, where I designed the animations, backgrounds, enemy tracking, and transitions. A talented friend provided custom music, granting me the rights to use it in the demo. I crafted all the artwork from scratch, ensuring smooth movement within the constraints of my timeline. Effective task and time management were crucial in maintaining progress and completing each phase before advancing to the next.

One of the significant challenges was enabling the player to move vertically in the play space, as this functionality wasn't built into Unity by default. I had to dig deep to figure that out while also ensuring proper animation blending. Overall, I emerged from the project eager to explore more advanced concepts, such as coroutines, which I utilized at a level that showed me the potential for even greater applications.


Here are some of the essential sections I organized and would like to highlight:

1. [Animations](#Animations)
2. [Player Traversal](#Traversal)
3. [Enemy Behavior](#EnemyBehavior)

## Animations <a name="Animations">

## Traversal

Here is the code I used to navigate the player along the x and y axis, creating a nostalgic feel reminiscent of classic beat'em up games.
